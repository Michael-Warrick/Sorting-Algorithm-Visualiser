# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser

An informative and visual/audible way to preview the efficiency of a particular sorting algorithm in order to observe how it sorts in real time and to potentially give insight as to where improvements could be made. 

## Features - Current

### Sorting
All algorithms sort and perform within their expected time complexity with no crashes or slowdowns.

### UI
The graph updates in real time showing the current index of interest and showing what is happening to the value based on colour coding: green, being for reading and red being for writing.

There is an array access counter to display in realtime an incremental counter on how many arrays are being accessed during sorting and also the time it took before the animation begins to actually sort using the current algorithm.

An algorithm's name, current index and associated value are labeled on each axis to help better get a scale of the data being sorted.

Finally, there are two themes as of now, a light and a dark theme.

## Features - Upcoming
Plans in the future are to add an optional toggle for being able to hear the algorithm sort in real time and also to be able to reset it, vary from either ascending or descending and select any saved algorithm from a dropdown menu. Plans for an icon can also be listed here.
